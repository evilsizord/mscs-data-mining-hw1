# Data Mining Assignment #1

This is a basic implementation of an image classifier. It uses TensorFlow to classify images from the [Caltech 101 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maricinnamon/caltech101-airplanes-motorbikes-schooners) on Kaggle.

1. Login to Kaggle (create an account if you don't have one already)
1. Go to your profile. Under Account > API, click create a new token
1. This should generate a JSON file with your API credentials

## How to Run

1. Load the included python notebook (.ipynb file) in a notebook runner like Jupyter.
1. Upload your Kaggle token (kaggle.json) into the notebook environment
1. Run all tasks in the notebook!
